Neil Armstrong Elementary School is a Comprehensive Service Site (CSS) for Fairfax County. This means that they have a larger percentage of the students requiring Special Education services.

On Thursday, December 20th, I volunteered as a chaperone on a field trip with 3 self-contained autism classes. The trip was to the “We Rock the Spectrum Kid’s Gym” in Sterling, Virginia. This gym contains an indoor playground with a climbing wall, trampoline, several swings, a horizontal ladder, dress-up area, and a zip-line where I was helping. The zip-line stretched across the gym and had a ball for the children to hold and sit on for the ride. But then the ball had to be manually returned for the next child. So, I was at the lower end of the run to help ensure the zip-line rider was above the largest mat for climbing off and then I returned the seat to the adult at the beginning of the line for the next child.

The trip was for fun but also allowed the children to have an experience outside their normal routine or schedule. In addition, the field trip allowed the children to have some interaction with adults that they didn’t know in a safe environment. The children enjoyed the zip-line, so they were put at ease and excited to tell me about their ride. They quickly began to give me high 5’s as I helped them down.

In addition to the field trip, I volunteered lunch hours in the library during the week of December 17th-December 22nd. Due to limited funding, this school recently lost their library assistant. So, I shelved the books that the children returned for 3 days during the week. This allowed the librarian to spend time with the children instead of needing to do this task herself every day.

The librarian also does some crafts with the classes. Some of her volunteers help with crafts but I cut out numbers for a set of bins that will hold books in one of the school pods. The numbers allow the books to be sorted by difficulty, so the children can more easily find appropriate books for their reading level. I also stamped some new books that came in for the school.

The school staff was very appreciative of the help that I was able to offer and thanked me repeatedly for coming in.
