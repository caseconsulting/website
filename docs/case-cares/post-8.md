On Saturday, January 19, several employees braved the cold to help clean-up wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery as part of the Wreaths Across America program. Starting at 8am, employees, dispersed throughout the grounds, gathered wreaths that were laid at each tombstone and collected them on poles, ropes, arms, etc. and deposited them into dumpsters for disposal. The event was well organized and drew hundreds of local volunteers from Boy Scout troops to high school lacrosse teams. Case employees were more than happy to put in a little work to honor those that are laid to rest in Arlington.
