I spent a few hours of my volunteer time supporting an effort I've supported a few years now - the local Loudoun County Salvation Army Food Truck. Each week local organizations (civic, community, church) take a turn preparing meals to be distributed to those in need at the Sterling and Leesburg locations. Typically its a hot meal, but can also be sandwiches, etc. Donations are gathered at the organization, placed on the truck , and away we go to hand out food to those in need.

This past weekend, our team was up. It's something I've done with some buddies of mine over the years. I've brought my son (good learning lesson) and this weekend was my nephew who wanted to help out. We had a hot meal of pastas with meat sauce, fresh fruits, breads, sweets, water, etc. The goal to give those that might not have a balanced diet, just that. At least once for the week. No questions asked, we give out what we have until we are out. Families, individuals, teens, homeless, those needing a little help. All were served.

Over the years, I've learned many valuable lessons, this weekend was no different. Here are some random thoughts:

I am blessed to have the family, friends, and loved ones I have
Loudoun County is not prepared to handle its growing homeless problem
Not everyone is looking for a handout, but sometimes a helping hand and a smile
Homelessness isn't a label, it can effect anyone at any time
Someone offered US a donation for the food we gave them (that was tough)
I served meals, offered a joke, tried to brighten someones day
Some were very appreciative, some not so much
CASE Cares, thank you for the opportunity to serve my community

Overall the four hours I spent were well worth it. It made me go back and think of ways I can help address the problem. Getting involved, writing my elected officials , and just raising awareness that others need help. Often Loudoun County is called "the richest county in the country", but in many cases we fall short helping those that need it most. Mental health issues, unemployment, foster care til 18 then out on the street, lack of family support, the list is endless how people can become lost. I've just happy the Salvation Army in Loudoun County continues their mission. Plus we got to run the red lights on RT 7 as we drove from Sterling to Leesburg, and that was REALLY COOL!!
