Yesterday, I spent the day as a Watch Dog at Greenville Elementary School where my daughter attends 1st grade. This was my second Watch Dog day since mid-October, and it was just as enjoyable as the first. As you'll see in the schedule below every minute is accounted for and it makes for a tired dog at the end of the day.

In the morning I joined the art teacher with her 4th grade class in the school's Innnovation Lab watching the stop animation projects they have been working on. This was a cross-discipline project where the kids had to make multiple scenes/backdrops, multiple characters, and come up with a story for those characters and scenes. Once all of the art work was completed the kids used iPads to capture the images for the stop-motion animation. They then compiled all the images into a movie and then recorded and added the audio. Finally, the kids created credits scenes with the name of the movie and the names of all of the kids in the group. It was an impressive project!

After that I was reunited with Claire's kindergarten teacher from last year for a holiday craft that had the kids making Rudolph bags to hold the reindeer food to spread on their lawns Christmas Eve.

I then enjoyed recess and lunch with my daughter and her class and followed that up with more recess and lunch monitoring for the other grades. In case you were wondering, the boys still spend more time arguing over rules and what down it is than actually playing "football". Yes, elementary school boys still have their own monetary system. These days they apparently deal in Pokemon cards.

I then ended the day with 2nd grade gym, 1st grade sight word evaluation, and saying goodbye to everyone as they left school at the end of the day. It was such a rewarding experience to spend so much time in the school. The Watch D.O.G.S. t-shirt breaks down all of the boundaries that would normally exist between the kids and a perfect stranger. Kids were coming up to me all day asking me for one thing or another. I will definitely be doing several more Watch Dog days in 2019!

Final Stats
