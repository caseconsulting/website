Along with friends from our church and my brother-in-law & sister-in-law, my family and I volunteered a few hours of our time at the Operation Christmas Child distribution center in Columbia, MD on December 7th.

Operation Christmas Child is one of the many outreach ministries of Samaritans Purse, a nondenominational, Christian organization providing spiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world. The ministry involves people giving of their time and money to pack shoeboxes with items to bless children in need around the world.

My family and I have packed and given shoe boxes for the last several years through our church. My wife and I have used this project to teach our daughter about giving. The items given in each shoe box usually includes a Bible, a small toy, hygiene products, and clothing items. If desired, tracking can be added so the giver learns the final destination of their boxes.

Last year, my wife and daughter volunteered their time with our church at the Baltimore processing center. With encouragement and knowing how much they enjoyed the event, I joined them this time to volunteer.

Our team, consisting of eight of us, had preregistered for this event for a four-hour shift. Upon arrival at the processing center, we checked-in and were given a 12 minute orientation on our job duties. We were instructed on how to properly inspect the shoe boxes, remove monetary donations, remove inappropriate items, seal the shoe boxes, scan the barcodes for tracking, and pack the shoe boxes in the shipping containers. After the orientation, we were shown to our assembly station and were joined by four other volunteers from Maryland and Virginia to begin our duties. My wife and daughter inspected the shoe boxes while I was responsible for packing the sealed shoeboxes into the shipping containers and loading them onto the conveyor belt for shipping. For the next four hours this is all I did. Throughout our work, we were given updates on our processing numbers for the day (somewhere around 41k boxes were processed through our shift) and told some uplifting stories on how the shoe boxes have impacted their recipients. We learned the boxes we processed would be shipped to Columbia and to the Ukraine.

Volunteers from states from all-around the mid-Atlantic have come to the Baltimore processing center. While it was hard work (my back is feeling it as I write this), it was very encouraging to me to know that people in need appreciate the gifts and learn about Jesus. Working with others to share our time and effort for a great cause was uplifting. We plan on making this a yearly tradition!
