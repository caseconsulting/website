On March 5th I spent the day volunteering at my daughter Emma's school (Round Hill Elementary) as a Watch D.O.G.S dad. This is the same program Paul Correll volunteered in with his daughter. The main goals of the program are to increase male role model involvement in education and to provide an extra set of eyes/ears to enhance school security.

This was my second time volunteering and I definitely feel that I get just as much out of it as the kids. It was amazing to see how eager and excited they were to teach me about what they were working on. Experiencing the curriculum firsthand, across each grade level, definitely sparked a lot of ideas of fun learning activities we could do at home with our kids. Round Hill ES is currently in a Computer Science Immersion program called Code to the future. Each class I visited were doing some type of STEAM focused activity. It was interesting to see how they are building up computer science concepts throughout the different grade levels. For example, K-2 start with simple Scratch programs working their way up to programming Lego Mindstorm EV3 (3rd grade), Micro:bit, Makey-makey(4th-5th).

Here were the highlights of the day (edited out most of the boring stuff)
5th Grade - Working on Lego Mindstorm EV3 project. Their robots were to focus on solving an environmental problem, such as cleaning up ship wreckage from the ocean floor.
3rd Grade - Healthy Habits Outline. The whole focus of this project was to provide the kids a framework for which to organize their ideas. Apparently that is a big hurtle for 3rd graders.
Kindergarten - Coding Graphs - Kids were coloring square on a graph then they had to translates those colors to a list of x value, y value, color used worksheet.
5th Grade - Math sheets: We were given a sheet with 2 large subtraction problems with 10 blanks. Our job was to fill in those blanks with 0 - 9 not reusing any of the numbers. I'll admit it, I struggled a bit. The kids made me feel better by saying it was the hardest one they'd had so far.
1st Grade - Book Reports (yuck) - The only redeeming quality of this one was that the student I got chose Steve jobs. My job was to help him research significant facts about Jobs. We both agreed that the he made some pretty cool stuff but it was really neat that he was in a club dubbed the "Wireheads".
4th Grade - Innovation Lab - They coded pedometers with Micro:bit chips and were testing out theories on how to get the most steps. I recommended you just swing it around by the battery cord. In hindsight, probably not what the teacher was looking for (but effective!).
Kindergarten - Recess - We played monsters and I chased them around the playground for about 40 minutes straight. I got my steps for the day by 2:30. Exhausted!
