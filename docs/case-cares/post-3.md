John and I started volunteering with the Men's Shelter of Charlotte this summer as a way to continue the work done by our daughter, Brandy.

The Men's Shelter of Charlotte operates 2 shelters with 400 beds. Every day the Men's Shelter of Charlotte provides lunch and dinner to 150 - 200 men at their Charlotte location. John and I helped setup and serve lunch to approximately 150 men this past weekend.

The focus of the Men's Shelter of Charlotte is to help individuals find housing and employment. They provide one-on-one interview coaching, assistance with employment connections, and help implementing a transportation plan to interviews and placements. They also work with each individual to help them obtain housing by providing housing specialists for information, guidance, and referrals to housing options. Their goal is to help these men move off the street and into productive lives.
